# ML Workshop: exploring survival on the Titanic

This Jupyter Notebook was used to give a workshop about Machine Learning with Python in Brazil with the support of [Campus Party Brasil](http://brasil.campus-party.org).

The Notebook is a Machine Learning Solution to a Kaggle Competition. You can read more about the challenge here: [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and learning purposes. 

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7
* Jupyter Notebook (I recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/))

### Download/Clone repository

Download or clone this repository to your machine (it includes jupyter notebook and titanic)

### Start your own ```Jupyter Notebook```

**Windows**

Inside your project folder with all the files from this repository, open cmd and run the command ```jupyter notebook```. Your cmd should looke like the image below:
